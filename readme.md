# Day 1️⃣ 🌱
- ` values and variables`
a value is the smallest unit of information while a variable is a container for storing information which can be used over and over again.

# rules for naming variables
- ` cannot start with numbers. `
- ` cannot start with a uppercase letter. `
- ` cannot start with a javascript reserved keywords `
- ` must start with a lowercase letter`
- ` cannot contain spaces. `

always name your variables with rememberable names and descrptive ..... 😂💯

```javascript
// right way
let mylastLocation = "Osaka";
let desiredLocation = " Okinawa "
// wrong way
let locationA = "osaka";
let locationB = " okinawa";
```

``` javascript
let dogs_name = "bruno"; // right way to name variables.
let 3years = 14; // wrong way of naming variables ❌❎ SyntaxError. 
let name = " Maria"; // allowed javascript reserved keywords but not recommended.
```
- `data types`

javascript has two data types

# primitive types

- `number`
floating point number 👉🏻 used for decimal and integer
```javascript
let patientAge = 10;
```
- `string`
sequence of characters 👉🏻 used for text
```javascript
let patientName  = "monica";
```
- `boolean`
logical type that can only be true or false 👉🏻 used for taking decision..
```javascript
let patientAge = true;
```
- `undefined`
value taken by a variable that is not yet defined ('empty value') 
```javascript
let patientName;
```
- `null`
empty value 
- `symbol`
not used anymore
- `big init`
larger intergers than the Number type can hold


# Topics Covered by JavaScript 
# 👋🏻 Hello World in JavaScript

    alert("Hello World"); //alert
    let firstName = " Jerry";

## 💭 The Idea

The main idea behind this project was my desire to gain a deeper understanding of how to learn and get a deep understanding of JavaScript language.......

Luminance is calculated by converting a color from its hexadecimal representation to RGB values and then applying the sRGB gamma correction.

By the way, this course is beginner friendly and suits everyone with nice approach and well designed. for 🌱🧒🏻



```javascript
    console.log("bright of JavaScript");

```
